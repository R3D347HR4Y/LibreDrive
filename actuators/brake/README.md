# Brake Acutator
General documentation for development surrounding the brake actuator

## Requirements
Note: ** double asterisks mark soft requirements that can be changed. This allows us
to determine other requirements in order to move on with a design

General
- ** Under $150 for complete BOM

Mechanical
- Can exert 700N a distance of 50mm (resolution 2mm) to end of brake pedal
- Emergency mechanical release decouples actuator from pedal
- Can withstand human input of 2500N
- Does not restrict pedal's full range of motion

Electrical

Option 1: 700N, 0.3s actuation time, 50mm travel
- Estimated Power: ~120W
- ** Input Voltage: 12V
